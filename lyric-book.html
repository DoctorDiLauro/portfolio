      <h3 class="push-1-2">Type</h3>
      <p>For each song in the book, the titles were done by hand, which is common feature in the bands album art. I also wanted to visually express the singer’s unique style by hand drawing certain phrases to be distorted and warped.</p>

      <p>The supporting visuals were hand torn from magazines, and collaged together by hand. As with type, hand made imagery is common in the band’s visuals, most notably on the album Feels, a personal favourite.</p>
